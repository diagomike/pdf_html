He was to establish the Kingdom of God in the earth with principles to live by, God\u2019s ways of doing things, a new language, and a new mentality. Today, we\u2019re a nation, a Kingdom of priests with a mission and ministry in the earth.</p><p>Thanks be unto God, we heeded the call when He said, <i>\u201c\u2026as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you\u201d</i> (John 20:21). We\u2019re fulfilling His mandate, the continuation of the ministry of Jesus to set up a kingdom not made by hands\u2014the Kingdom of Heaven in the earth.</p><p>To have a better grasp and understanding of this truth, let\u2019s take a look at how Luke, who wrote the gospel of Luke and the book of Acts, concluded: <i>\u201cAnd he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen\u201d</i> (Luke 24:50-53). How touching this is!</p><p>Mark in his account first reiterated what Luke said: <i>\u201cSo then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God\u201d</i> (Mark 16:19). In addition, he recounted what the apostles did next in the 20th verse: <i>\u201cAnd they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen\u201d</i> (Mark 16:20). They went and preached everywhere! That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing today as well. Don\u2019t be left out.</p><p>Preach the Gospel with passion. Recall what the Lord charged us to do: <i>\u201cHeal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give\u201d</i> (Matthew 10:8). He has given us both the power and authority to do mighty works in His Name and demonstrate the character of the Spirit to our world.</p><p>Therefore, take your place in the ministry of the Gospel. Never lose focus of the Master\u2019s calling on your life. This is your mission and ministry in the earth. Serve Him selflessly with undying passion.</p>",
